#### Report

&ensp;&ensp;Throughout this assessment I could finally understand better the basics concepts to deploy an android App, it helped me as a practice 
to use, test and study many .xml tags, elements from the design window, and a little bit of Kotlin, by the time I started this assignment 
I was a lot lost about what I should do and how I would do it, so with the android studio up and running I started playing around with the
software, delving each folder and files that were created by default, so when I started really doing the AboutMeApp I started from the layout, 
which was one of the things that was more difficult to understand, for instance which type od layout I should have used, but once 
I was using each of then I could finally understand better when to use each one, and that was for sure really import, I would say that is
the first step to take for anyone who is starting from zero to deploy an App, because only after that I could start using <image>,<button>,<textview>,
and so on, I would say I master those concepts, but thanks to this assignment I definitely have a better idea of the most imports tags in .xml,
this App took me more than 12 hours to finally release the first version, I have not implemented any feature that was really hard to code, however
everything I have done I understand well how I did and how it works, I have used Linear Layouts with orientation vertical and horizontal
, constraint layout and also a scrollview layout in all of the pages, if I have to do the same or any other App I know I could definitely
organize it better, specially the attributes of each layout, I have completed most of the requirements I would say 90% of them, including the stack(history of the pages)
I configure the launch mode of each page and it works just fine, however I had in mind an idea of doing a little bit different but I
just could not, I thought I understood well this concept and I still think I did, however I could implemented it the way I want, as i said it is 
working just fine, when I open an activity for the second time for example, the app does not open a new activity but it opens the activity from
the stack, but doing it and understand was still one of my biggest challenge for this assessment, hopefully by the next classes and assessment 
I will be able to learn more and understand everything better.
